Terminology:
------------
Motherboard
  - This links all of the separate parts together

CPU: Central Processing Unit (Measured in GHz)
  - Does all of the computation
  - Very good at doing one thing at a time

RAM: Random Access Memory (Measured in Gigabytes (GB))
  - Short term memory
  - Fast
  - Cleared every time the computer restarts
  - Amounts vary 2GB - 128GB
    - Special Motherboards are required to have higher amounts of RAM

HDD: Hard Disk Drive (Measured in Gigabytes (GB), Terabytes (TB) or Petabytes (PB))
  - Persistent Memory
  - Slower (But this is changing with new hardware on motherboards)
  - Generally when programming files are loaded from the HDD into RAM
    - If files are too big to fit into RAM small sections of the files are loaded at a time

GPU: Graphical Processing Unit (Measured in GHz)
  - Also a processor
  - Very good at doing lots of things at the same time
    - There is normally a single dataset in which all elements will undergo the same operation
    - Eg: Matrix multiplications
  - Contains its own RAM called VRAM (between 1GB and 24GB currently)
